  AL's The Beautify Mod (Ver 5) for Paleon 1.6.1
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This mod introduces dozens of new plants that are edible, decorative, and useable in crafting dyed items such as red tunics or blue wool coats. Other natural resources are also available, such as sand to make Glass and Limestone to make sculptures. Technology has been simplified and may not reflect real-life equivalents exactly to preserve playability.

This mod is always a work-in-progress and suggestions are welcome. Just remember that this is a mod that strives to keep in tune with the original Paleon look and feel. So, not everything will be emplemented.

  UPDATES
╚═════════╝

Added the dry manure fuel to most buildings that use fuel. If I missed one, please let me know!

Nursery: You can now grow trees in a nursery to produce wood. This helps with automation for bigger colonies.

Mining Machine: Now you can mine using cattle and horses! Must be placed over an empty deposit spot.

Time Machine: Updated materials needed to create Time Machine to include custom advanced items to make the end game slightly harder.

Removed Foods: Lettuce, Red Cabbage, Red beets, and Tumeric have been removed so that the food list doesn't expand past a single monitor of space. I'll add them back when some sort of scrolling is added. Other foods have been adjusted to only be ingredients to also help with this.

New Foods: Pumpkins, Jack-O-Lanterns, and Pumpkin Pie just in time for October!

Tree Tappers: Now you can tap sap from Pine and Maple Trees. Due to how the game is, you cannot add a tapper to an already grown tree, but instead plant a tree with a tapper. Tapped Trees can be found in FOOD once unlocked.

Auto Oven: Set and Forget! Will automatically make food once a recipe is chosen by settler and the ingredients are delivered.

Pathways: All pathways have been updated per request so that the better the material you use, the faster settlers and animals will travel on it. 

Candles: Can be created by wax or animal fat and are used as a fuel source for the advanced crafting places.

Advanced Crafting: Crafting & Knowledge Desks will allow for faster crafting but need candles as fuel to use.

Blast Furnace: Used to make steel and silicon ingots as well as previous materials faster.

Food Press: Can be used to make oils and extract wax and honey from honeycombs. Use millstone or similar to create larger quantities of sugar from honey.

Solar Power: Solar Panels and charging stations along with recipes to create batteries. Some buildings will take batteries instead of traditional fuel like charcoal or wood.

Dye Station, available after weaving and alcohol technologies are unlocked, allows you to use various plants to create primative dyed outfits. These outfits do not offer much protection as they are merely cosmetic.
Once Dye Station is unlocked, Vinegar will be createable in fermentation pot. Vinegar is needed to dye clothes.

Quarry, looks identical to mines but allows you to fish out other materials such as sand, limestone, and silicon. You cannot pull out materials until they are unlocked via technologies. 

Flower Walls, These are decorative walls featuring various flowers. Each material needs to be unlocked before it can be used as a flower-wall. (Mudbrick flower wall cannot be built until you unlock mudbricks, brick flower walls will not be available until you unlock bricks, etc.)

Statues, currently are only for show, but may have an effect in later updates. Fountians need to be toggled "close" to animate as they're technically "gates."

Gates: Larger Wood and iron gates available that close a 2x2 space. Also smaller iron gate that closes a 1x1 space also available. 

Lanterns: Copper, Bronze, and Iron lanterns along with lanterns on poles for authstetic lighting. Solar lights are also available once solar technology is unlocked.

Edible Plants:
Carrots, Onions, Red Beets, Wineberries, Lettuce, Avacado, Lemons, Tumeric, Mulberries, Blueberries, and Timothy Hay, which will turn into 4 pieces of hay when cut.

Cosmetic plants:
Dames Rockets, Rose Bushes, Multi-Flora Rose Bushes, Butterfly Bushes, and a Star-shaped flower. These do not need seeds to plant, as they are for decoration purposes only.

Trees:
Sycamore, Pine, & Redwood trees function the same as Oaks, except redwood are rarer and drop a little more wood when cut.
